                <div id="demo" class="collapse"><p>The first mention of a dish similar to dumplings comes from ancient Greece, but the Ural region seems to be the origin place of the pelmeni. The word pelmeni is derived from pel'n'an' (пельнянь)—literally "ear bread" in the Finnic Komi and Udmurt languages.[5] It is unclear when pelmeni entered the cuisines of the indigenous Siberian people and when they first appeared in Russian cuisine. One theory suggests pelmeni, or stuffed boiled dumplings in general, originated in Siberia, possibly a simplified adaptation of the Chinese jiaozi (in some dialects it is called Bāomiàn "包麵/包面"). Another theory suggests that pelmeni were carried by the Mongols to Siberia and the Urals, from where they gradually spread as far as Eastern Europe. Pelmeni became especially popular by Russian hunters.
                Pelmeni are a particularly good means of quickly preserving meat during the long Siberian winter, especially eliminating the need to feed livestock during the long winter months. Thus, despite their Uralic origin, pelmeni were much influenced by the Siberian way of cooking.</p>

                <h3>List of ingredients for dough</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 cup flour</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup lukewarm water</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>List of ingredients for filling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 lb ground meat pork, chicken, turkey, and/or ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 large onion grated</li>
                    <li>1/2 tbsp salt to taste</li>
                    <li>1 tsp pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How to make</h3> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add the eggs and mix until incorporated. Add water.</li>
                    <li>Using a stand mixer, mix the dough until smooth. Sprinkle flour onto a flat work surface.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix the ground meat, grated onion, salt, and pepper with your hands until well-combined.</li>
                    <li>To save time, use a pelmeni mold to shape the dumplings. To do so, roll out a flat piece of dough and place it on the well-floured mold. Fill each hole with meat.</li>
                    <li>Make another flat, round piece of dough and place it on top. Sprinkle with flour and use a rolling pin to roll over the dough until each dumpling is separated.</li>
                    <li>Flip the mold over and shake out the pelmeni. Dust them with flour. At this point, you can either freeze them for later or boil them to eat immediately.</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, you can make the pelmeni by hand. To do so, roll the dough out and cut small circles out of it using a cookie cutter. Place the meat mixture in the middle and fold over the sides into a half-moon shape, pinching the edges together to secure the filling inside. Connect the two corners together. Repeat until you have no dough or meat mixture left.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the pelmeni in. Once they float to the top, they are finished and ready to be taken out. Strain the pelmeni with a colander. Drizzle them with butter and serve with a side of sour cream. Enjoy!</li>
